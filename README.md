## Project Title: Stock Market Data Analysis using VBA

### Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. **Analyze Quarterly Stock Data**: Develop a VBA script that processes stock data for each quarter.
2. **Calculate Key Metrics**: Determine the ticker symbol, quarterly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock.
3. **Identify Significant Stocks**: Extend the script to identify the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.
4. **Automate Across Worksheets**: Ensure the script runs efficiently across all worksheets in a workbook.
5. **Implement Conditional Formatting**: Use conditional formatting to visually highlight positive and negative changes in stock prices.

### Data Analysis and Methodology

#### Basic Stock Data Analysis

Create a VBA script to loop through all the stocks for each quarter, calculating the following metrics:
- **Ticker Symbol**: The unique identifier for each stock.
- **Quarterly Change**: The difference between the opening price at the beginning of a quarter and the closing price at the end of the quarter.
- **Percentage Change**: The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a quarter to the closing price at the end of the quarter.
- **Total Stock Volume**: The total volume of stocks traded during the quarter.

The script should output the results in a structured format, similar to the provided example.

#### Enhanced Stock Analysis

Extend the functionality of the script to determine:
- **Greatest % Increase**: The stock with the highest percentage increase.
- **Greatest % Decrease**: The stock with the highest percentage decrease.
- **Greatest Total Volume**: The stock with the highest total volume of trades.

This information should be displayed prominently, matching the provided example layout.

#### Automation Across Worksheets

Modify the VBA script to process every worksheet in the workbook automatically. This ensures that the analysis is performed for each quarter without manual intervention.

#### Conditional Formatting

Incorporate conditional formatting within the VBA script to:
- Highlight positive changes in stock prices in green.
- Highlight negative changes in stock prices in red.

This visual aid will help quickly identify trends and significant changes in stock performance.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Software**: Microsoft Excel
- **Programming Language**: VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)

### Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of quarterly stock market data, automating the tedious process of calculating key metrics and identifying significant stock movements. By leveraging VBA scripting, the analysis becomes efficient, repeatable, and visually informative through conditional formatting.

### Future Work

Future enhancements could include:
- Adding more detailed financial metrics and ratios.
- Incorporating data from additional sources to provide more context.
- Developing a user-friendly interface for running the script and viewing results.
